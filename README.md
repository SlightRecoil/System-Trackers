## Weekly Scripting Challenge

I started this repository after losing motivation on a Qt project. While working with Qt, I realized I wasn’t learning as much as I wanted, so I decided to shift my focus. 
Instead of tackling another large project, I committed to writing a new script each week to become more fluent with my operating system (macOS) and improve how I interact with it through automation and scripting.

Over time, I adapted some of these scripts into SwiftBar plugins, allowing me to integrate them directly into the macOS menu bar for quick access.
I also use crontab to automate certain scripts, running them on a schedule without manual execution.

# Structure
	•	scripts/ – Standalone scripts written weekly
	•	swiftbar-plugins/ – Adapted versions of scripts for SwiftBar

# Goals
	•	Become more fluent with macOS through scripting
	•	Improve automation and system interaction skills
	•	Build a useful set of tools for daily workflow

# Usage

Most scripts are standalone and should run on macOS without additional dependencies. 
SwiftBar plugins should be placed in the appropriate directory (~/Library/Application Support/SwiftBar/Plugins) and made executable (chmod +x script.sh).

# Future Plans
	•	Expand beyond macOS-specific scripts
	•	Explore different scripting languages for variety
	•	Continue refining existing scripts into more polished tools

# AI Support
  I've used claude.ai to assist with learning and commentation/documentation, as well as automating boring and repetitive tasks.
